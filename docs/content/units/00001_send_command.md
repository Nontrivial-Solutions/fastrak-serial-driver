## Description

This unit describes the functionality of the Fastrak Device connection class. The class maintains a
serial connection to a physical Fastrak to which it issues commands.

### Members

#### Data

A `bytearray` of data from a data stream session.

### Interfaces

#### Constructor and Valid Class Function

The constructor method takes in a collection of data:

- Serial port name: A string representing which serial port to use to connect to the Fastrak.  
- Baudrate: A baudrate to use for the serial connection.
- Serial timeout: How long to wait for the serial connection.
- Station ID: The ID of the station (peripheral slot) to use on the Fastrak.
- Run setup flag: Indicates if the constructor should also set up the Fastrak.
- Binary or ASCII output flag: Indicates if the output should be ASCII or Binary.
- Polling Rate: The rate to poll the Fastrak in streaming mode.

> [!note]
>
> The position flow only works in binary mode.
